## My process

First I made a layout of the component structure dividing it by sectors and assigning the necessary DIVs with their corresponding classes in the HTML code. Then I edited and applied the styles according to the suggestions. In addition to the reference measurements, I used measurements obtained with Photoshop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Normalize.css used

### What I learned

In order to carry out this project, it was necessary to review and revise knowledge about the alignment of the elements.

### Continued development

This practice allowed me to realize that sometimes a little goes a long way, starting with small and achievable projects is better training.

### Useful resources

- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Normalize.css helped me to make browsers represent all elements more consistently.
- [Paul Irish Snippet](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) - This snippet helped me to give the box model I wanted. It applies to all elements.
